          <div class="story-content">
            <p>
              Casa Raudha Women Home was officially founded in 2008, with a
              primary goal to provide temporary shelter and new beginnings for
              women who were victims/survivors of domestic violence and abuse. Now
              entering its eighth year, Casa Raudha has come a long way from the
              small office it once occupied in a building along Sims Avenue to its
              current site today. The shelter welcomes women and their children
              who require protection, regardless of race or religion. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Now located inconspicuously within a residential neighbourhood, Casa Raudha owns
              a welcoming space that is able to house up to 50 women and their
              children who are recovering from their experiences of abuse and
              mistreatment. The new shelter is fully equipped with the necessary
              facilities to provide residents with a safe recovery and learning
              living space.
            </p>
            <p>
              Apart from providing our residents with shelter, Casa
              Raudha seeks to be a haven for them by motivating them to continue
              persisting towards making positive changes in their live. By
              empowering them to take control of their lives, Casa Raudha hopes
              that by the time these women leave the shelter, they are empowered
              with the confidence and skills to make informed choices and to lead
              independent lives not just for themselves, but for their children as
              well.
